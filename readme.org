* Spacemacs Customization for dvorak keyboard

put the contents of this repo in a directory named dvorak in your private
directory of .emacs.d

add (keyboard-layout :variables kl-layout 'dvorak)
to your .spacemacs dotspacemacs-configuration-layers list

This code is adapted from Fabien Dubosson's dvorak/bepo work for spacemacs
(mostly moving the movement keys right under home position)
